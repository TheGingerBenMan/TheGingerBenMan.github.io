This portfolio website was originally made for the Web Typography course at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and was worked on over the course of about half the semester. This was done directly following the business card project, which was my introduction into coding as a whole. Much like the previous project, there were a lot of struggles (most notably at the beginning) when making the site. Yet once I got my footing , I did not struggle too much. The most important takeaway is just taking building a site one step at a time, and try to make sure you fully understand what you are implementing into the site. I was very stuck on the nav bar and grid because I did not fully understand what it was when building it. However I was able to get help from my peers to fix issues that arose during the site building that I could not handle on my own.

More specifically I got help from Hunter Johnson on my mobile nav bar and Liz Trull helped me on the image gallery and some hover effects. Any major site breaking issues I could not comprehend Lara Henderson helped me a lot with as well. As I got towards the halfway point of making the project I was more confidently fixing and changing aspects of my website on my own.

The CSS grid was a big help, yet also a very confusing tool I used. I understand it now, but if I had to do anything differently I would have definitely learned about what it was and how to control it more before actually implementing it. I also used some CSS animations, with very little javascript. 

I think I improved a lot during the project and got a lot more interest in coding as a whole. I have always loved the freedom of creating and customizing, so making a website from the ground up was a very fun experience.
