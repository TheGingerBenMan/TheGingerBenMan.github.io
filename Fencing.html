    <h4 class="title-work">USA Fencing Study</h4>
    <p class="descriptiontext">
      The study of USA Fencing was a series of projects that took place over the course of a few months between early September to the middle of December of 2023. The basis of this endeavor was to select an event, in my case fencing, and then design material focused communicating information in different mediums.
    </p>
    <p class="descriptiontext">
      First I made a poster, featuring digital illustrations I drew early on in the design process. At this point I was still figuring out what kind of design style I thought would be best to convey the elegant spirit that came with fencing. Right away I stuck to a typeface, yet I wouldnâ€™t define a clear color palette until the booklet that followed. This booklet is 16 pages in length, including information about tournaments, staff, contact information, and a few other categories referenced from the official USA Fencing website. At this point I simplified the style I was going for significantly, choosing softer colors and low contrast gradients. 
    </p>
    <p class="descriptiontext"><a href="assets/Fencing Booklet Final.pdf">To view my booklet in a more natural format, I attached a PDF for easy viewing.
    </a></p>
    <p class="descriptiontext">
      Much of what I had in this booklet would be translated into web form through work in Adobe XD. I refined each spread, and altered them in a way that would best fit a mobile, tablet, and web environment. One crucial aspect I felt should carry over from the official website into my small rendition was the ribbon used for the navigation bar. I changed it up a bit with color and simplified the look to feel at home with the rest of the page. I used darker colors on the sides, as well as a shadow beneath it to convey depth on the page while a user would scroll through.
