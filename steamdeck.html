    <h4 class="title-work">The Steam Drink</h4>
    <p class="descriptiontext">
      Comparatively to the rest of my life, I am pretty new to steam. I never grew up playing computer games, or even knew what the site was for a long time. When I got the Steam Deck, it opened up a new world for me. In turn, I thought it would be a fun challenge to create an unexpected product in the style of the Steam brand. A drink came to mind for one of the potential choices, and it seemed like a good challenge to figure out how Steam could approach a product like this.

  I referenced the style of some pre-existing advertisements I found, such as holiday sale ads and the Steam Deck ads. Steam has a style guide readily available, which helped with making an end product that resembled an item that could have been made by steam.

      Steam has had a big impact on me, to the point where I had prior projects that focused on it too. This poster is one example, the goal of which was to make something that celebrated a human made object. This could have been something as little as a bottle opener, baseball cap, or a light bulb. I decided on using Valve's Steam Deck as my subject, as I had got it recently at the time of the project. It allowed me to play many games I was not able to before, and not only that, it gave me an easier avenue to play games with my friends. When I wasn't drawing or working on design projects, the Steam Deck would be one of the things I would decompress with. Beyond my interest in the object, it proved to be a nice challenge to render because of it's relatively complex design.
