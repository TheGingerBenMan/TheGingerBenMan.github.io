    <h4 class="title-work">Business Card Website</h4>
    <p class="descriptiontext">
      The Business Card website was a project in my Web Typography class at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. It was my first introduction into coding, as before I knew next to nothing about it. It was certainly an endeavor that kept me challenged the entire way through, especially with the card flip. I had to do a lot of problem solving for that one specifically. I even worked with one of my friends to help go through my code and figure out why certain parts were working and why others were not. Looking back on it, it really would not be nearly as much of a challenge to me now. Yet it proved to be a great introduction into learning HTML and CSS, and was a gateway for me to learn more about UI/UX design!
